Currently only supports Windows Steam, Linux support is coming relatively soon.

tl;dr - :Steam audio<Tab><CR>
        Launches Audiosurf (if you have it installed)

This is a plugin to launch steam games without having to leave vim. To use
it, you must have Steam installed (obvioulsy), and your Vim installation must
support Ruby. To check whether your Vim supports ruby, execute
    :ruby puts "It works!"

(this should cause the message "It works!" to be displayed in the status bar).
